Here is the analysis of the treatments: -
1.	the most effective treatments were Capomulin and Ramicane. Out of 10 treatments the highest number of mice received treatment using Capomulin while Propriva there were less mice which received treatment.
2.	Treatment of Mouse ID 1509 looked promising as it showed with time tumour decreased using Capomulin
3.	The Bar graph shows the highest number of mouse (230 Mice) were tested with Capomulin while the lowest number of mouse (148 mice) was tested with Propriva.
4.	The population of Female versus Male were even hence population was balanced
5.	Correlation between Mouse weight and average tumour volume shows that as weight increase also average tumour volume increases.
6.	In the regression analysis it is true when dependable variable (average tumor volume) changes if also mice weight changes
